# 💼 Acquisition & Marketing (How to find clients)

## 🎯 Target channels (MVP)
### 1) Upwork-focused
- Content that helps freelancers rank better:
  - “Upwork profile headline templates that convert”
  - “Keyword coverage checklist”
- Offer a free “Upwork profile score” audit as a lead magnet.

### 2) LinkedIn creators + communities
- Short-form posts:
  - “How I cut my gig search from 2h/day to 10 min/day”
  - “My weekly freelance pipeline dashboard template”
- DM automation is out; instead:
  - manual outreach to creators
  - affiliate deal for audience

### 3) Freelance Discord/Reddit/Slack
- Post value-first guides.
- Offer limited early access.

### 4) Partnerships
- Resume/CV writers
- freelance coaches
- small agencies

## 🧲 Lead magnets (concrete)
